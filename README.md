This project is a simple pizza dough calculator written in TypeScript. The main goal of the application is to calculate the ingredient quantities needed to prepare the dough based on five parameters: the number of dough portions, the weight of one portion, the hydration level, the weight of olive oil, and salt.

Hydration refers to the ratio of water to flour in the dough. It is an important parameter that affects the consistency and structure of the dough.

The application includes a user interface where the user can enter the desired number of dough portions and the hydration level. Based on these inputs, the application will calculate the required ingredient quantities.

The main features of the application include:

1. User Interface: Creating a user interface where the user can enter values for the number of dough portions, weight of one portion, hydration level, weight of olive oil, and salt.

2. Event Handling: Using TypeScript to capture the user's inputs and perform the calculations.

3. Calculation of Ingredient Quantities: Based on the user's inputs, such as the number of dough portions, weight of one portion, hydration level, weight of olive oil, and salt, the application will calculate the appropriate ingredient quantities.

4. Displaying the Results: The application will display the calculated ingredient quantities to the user. This can be done by showing them on a web page or as a message. Additionally, values can be rounded to the appropriate decimal places to ensure precision.

5. Displaying the Recipe: A simple recipe for either a slow-fermented dough or a quick dough can be included. Each user can choose the preferred method.

# Usage

After you've installed node, you should be able to use the program. The simplest use case would be run local server:

``` bash
 $ git run dev 
```

You don't have to build project with Vite because this process is done, but if you want fork this project remember to run build to update yours changes.

``` bash
 $ git run build 
```
  
Or you can open live server and build project in the same time.

``` bash
 $ git run preview 
```
